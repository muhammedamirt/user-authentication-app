# Authentication App

This is an authentication app built using React and Express.js. It utilizes JWT token-based authentication and Passport for user authentication and authorization. Redux is used for state management in the React front-end, and a token verification middleware is implemented in the Express.js backend.

## Overview (100 lines)

This authentication app provides a secure user authentication and authorization system. It leverages the following technologies and features:

- React: The front-end of the app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Express.js: The back-end of the app is developed using Express.js, a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- JWT Token: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and authorization. They are generated upon successful login and sent to the client for subsequent requests.
- Passport: Passport is integrated into the app as an authentication middleware. It provides various authentication strategies, such as local authentication using username and password.
- Redux: Redux is employed for state management in the React front-end. It allows for centralized state management and seamless interaction between components.
- Token Verification Middleware: A custom middleware is implemented in the Express.js backend to verify the authenticity and validity of JWT tokens. It intercepts incoming requests and ensures that only valid tokens are accepted.
- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their credentials, including username and password. The information is securely stored in the backend database.
- User Login: Registered users can log in with their credentials. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client for authorization in subsequent requests.
- Protected Routes: The app includes protected routes that can only be accessed by authenticated users with valid JWT tokens. Unauthorized access is restricted, ensuring the security of sensitive information.
- Error Handling: The app handles various error scenarios, such as invalid credentials, expired tokens, or unauthorized access, providing appropriate error messages to the user.
- Installation and Usage: The README file provides detailed instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, configure environment variables, and start the development server. It also includes information on how to register a new user, log in, and explore the app's features.

## Installation and Usage
